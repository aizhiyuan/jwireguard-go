# This file should be copied to vars and modified to reflect the
# configuration you desire.  It is sourced by most of the
# scripts and controls some parameters used in the scripts.

# NOTE: If you installed Easy-RSA from your distro's package manager,
#       DO NOT edit this file in place -- instead, you should copy
#       it from /usr/share/easy-rsa/vars.example to /etc/easy-rsa/vars,
#       and then edit /etc/easy-rsa/vars, or create a custom vars file
#       in a location of your choosing.

# WARNING: By default the only supported cipher used for token signing
#          and encryption is SHA256 - do not change the value below!

# For more details, please see:
#   * openvpn --show-ciphers
#   * openvpn --show-digests
#   * openvpn --show-tls

# If you use `digest' authentication (note that this requires
# both server and client to have the required cipher and HMAC
# modules compiled in), enable these to improve the data channel
# security (note that if you run a multi-client server and you
# use this feature, every client must use --tls-auth and
# have a key of the same length as the server's, but you must
# not use --duplicate-cn).

# See the man page for more info on --tls-auth and --secret.
